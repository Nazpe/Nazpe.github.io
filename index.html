subtitle: Data, ML and AI enthusiast

<br>My expertise lies in applying data techniques
 to create measurable impact, moving beyond theoretical models to build 
 systems that solve real-world challenges. I have a special interest in applying ML and AI concepts 
in healthcare and engineering tasks.<br><br>

I obtained my MSc in Data Science & AI and my BSc in Biotechnology from the <a href="https://www.ua.pt/en/">University of Aveiro</a>. 
My masters thesis project involved developing ML methods to analyse medical data and predict pneumonia death in a hospital setting. 
After that I started worked at intersections of engineering and data. You can find out more in my resume.<br><br>

In my free time, I love playing music, working out, travelling, and stepping out of my comfort zone.:)<br><br>
