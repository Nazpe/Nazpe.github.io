subtitle: Data, ML and AI enthusiast

<br>My expertise lies in applying data techniques
 to create measurable impact, moving beyond theoretical models to build 
 systems that solve real-world challenges. I have a special interest in applying ML and AI concepts 
in healthcare and engineering tasks.<br><br>

Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a><br><br>

I obtained my MSc in Data Science & AI and my BSc in Biotechnology from the University of Aveiro. 
My masters thesis project involved developing ML methods to analyse medical data and predict pneumonia death in a hospital setting.<br><br>

The projects and publication pages are a nice way to see some of my work, but you can also view my resume here.<br><br>

In my free time, I love playing music, working out, travelling, and stepping out of my comfort zone.:)<br><br>
