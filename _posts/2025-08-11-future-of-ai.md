## Abstract

Artificial intelligence is changing industries and communities around the world in many areas, thus ethical principles have to be taken into account for a balanced evolution of the society. Bias, transparency, explain ability and fairness are some of the key areas that AI algorithms developers must consider. Some possible future problems, as unemployment and treats to democracy, and some problems that are appearing now, like treats to privacy, must be taken into account now before it’s too late to prevent them. For this, research and education in AI are essential.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as a field that combines computer science and good datasets to permit problem-solving, for this, logic-based techniques and advanced analysis techniques are applied, like machine learning and deep learning, to interpret, support and automate decisions to take into action. It permits to reduce costs and increase productivity in industries, due to the accuracy and precision it provides [2][5][9].

Artificial intelligence is radically changing industries and communities around the world. It has become ingrained in many parts of today’s era society, from video viewing recommendations and autonomous driving cars to online purchase recommendations, ad
vertisements, fraud detection, generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and many others. 

In the near future, more companies will use AI to address specific problems. By 2025, according to Gartner, 50% of businesses already have platforms for using AI, when in 2020 just 10% of companies used it. But this is just the beginning, because it is expected that the ways we work, live, and interact with others will change even more. In one side, it is anticipated that this new revolution will enhance and improve our lives and societies. However, in the other, it could result in significant changes to our way of life and society standards. 

The time  to comprehend these technologies influence and anticipate their unfavourable implications is shrinking. Therefore, it is very important to take ethical principles into account and do not let the evolution of technology continue to outpace its proper regulation[5][9][8][17]

# 2 THE FUTURE OF AI

At leading firms, there is currently a transition from artificial intelligence being a additional feature to a key feature, because AI is becoming more integral to company operations and strategy.  AI will reach and expand in a lot of areas of interest, bringing a lot of innovation and progress into those areas, some examples of what is expected to happen are the following:

* **Medicine and Healthcare:** AI can help automate repetitive tasks to save time, with evidence-based decisions by identifying risk factors, it can anticipate outcomes even using patient-specific algorithms. It is expected that it will help to prevent around 86 percent of errors in the healthcare sector, while, at the same time, reducing costs. It will also permit a better understanding of the different elements (like birthplace, diet, pollution, etc.) that affect a person’s health, even permitting to discover when a person is most likely to develop a chronic illness and offer pre-emptive treatment to stop its advancement. This gives insight that permits to alter undesirable outcomes into a better clinical result[8][6].

* **Retail:** Retailers can save over $340 billion by 2022 if they
 implement AI throughout all of their business operations,
 according to a Capgemini study. And, by the end of 2022, Ac
centure estimates that investments in AI will increase retail
 revenues by 38%, when compared to the end of 2021. Ama
zon is already trying to determine the safety of operations
 for delivering items with drones. This can be a reality in the
 next ten years. Also, this will lead to a more autonomous
 and individualized experience, with dressing rooms with
 screens, virtual racks customized according to data-defined
 personas and more personalization based on past behaviours
 and trends[6].
