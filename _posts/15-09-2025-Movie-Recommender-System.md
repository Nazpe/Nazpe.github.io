At its heart, collaborative filtering is incredibly intuitive. The core idea is brilliantly simple: "Show me what you enjoy, and I'll track down others who share your taste. Then, I'll tell you about the stuff they discovered that you haven't seen yet."

It's all about tapping into the collective wisdom of a big group of people to produce personalized suggestions. Instead of getting to know what a movie is (like its genre or who's in it), it focuses entirely on how people interact with movies.
