## Abstract

Artificial intelligence is changing industries and communities around the world in many areas, thus ethical principles have to be taken into account for a balanced evolution of the society. Bias, transparency, explain ability and fairness are some of the key areas that AI algorithms developers must consider. Some possible future problems, as unemployment and treats to democracy, and some problems that are appearing now, like treats to privacy, must be taken into account now before it’s too late to prevent them. For this, research and education in AI are essential.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as a field that combines computer science and good datasets to permit problem-solving, for this, logic-based techniques and advanced analysis techniques are applied, like machine learning and deep learning, to interpret, support and automate decisions to take into action. It permits to reduce costs and increase productivity in industries, due to the accuracy and precision it provides [2][5][9].

Artificial intelligence is radically changing industries and communities around the world. It has become ingrained in many parts of today’s era society, from video viewing recommendations and autonomous driving cars to online purchase recommendations, ad
vertisements, fraud detection, generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and many others. 

In the near future, more companies will use AI to address specific problems. By 2025, according to Gartner, 50% of businesses already have platforms for using AI, when in 2020 just 10% of companies used it. But this is just the beginning, because it is expected that the ways we work, live, and interact with others will change even more. In one side, it is anticipated that this new revolution will enhance and improve our lives and societies. However, in the other, it could result in significant changes to our way of life and society standards. 

The time  to comprehend these technologies influence and anticipate their unfavourable implications is shrinking. Therefore, it is very important to take ethical principles into account and do not let the evolution of technology continue to outpace its proper regulation[5][9][8][17]
