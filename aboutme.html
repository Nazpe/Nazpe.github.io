<br>My expertise lies in applying data techniques
 to create measurable impact, moving beyond theoretical models to build 
 systems that solve real-world challenges. I have a special interest in applying my ML and AI skills 
in healthcare and engineering tasks.<br><br>

I obtained my MSc in Data Science & AI and my BSc in Biotechnology from the <a href="https://www.ua.pt/en/">University of Aveiro</a>. 
My masters thesis project involved developing ML methods to analyse medical data and predict pneumonia death in a hospital setting. 
After that I worked at the intersection of engineering and data. You can find more in my <a href="https://nazpe.github.io/resume">resume</a>.<br><br>

In my free time, I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKw27mXxHlQ&ab_channel=Filarm%C3%B3nicadeMonteRedondo-SenhoradaPiedade">playing music</a>, working out, travelling, and stepping out of my comfort zone.<br><br>
