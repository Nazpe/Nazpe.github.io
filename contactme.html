  <h1>Help feed me & my coding obsession</h1>
  <p>If you want to show your support for any of the <a href="/projects">open source projects</a> I devote my time to, here's a PayPal one-time Donate button that you may click :) You can also choose to become an official sponsor for my long-term development of open-source projects (sponsoring me comes with some <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/daattali">additional perks for you</a>).</p>

  <p>My open-source projects started as a fun hobby, but as my tools and content got more popular, it has turned into a full-time job commitment (often taking up 20-40 hours per week). Except with 0 pay and no employer benefits :) My goal is to be able to focus as much as I can on <strong>open-source work that benefits the entire community</strong> rather than individual clients, and I can only reach that goal by getting supported for my hard work.</p>
