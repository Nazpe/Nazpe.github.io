I wrote and presented an article based on this work to the CIARP 2023 conference (26th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition). [The paper can be found in the proceedings of the conference, here.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49249-5_3)

My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
