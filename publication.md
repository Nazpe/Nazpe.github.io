I wrote and presented an article based on this work to the CIARP 2023 conference (26th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition). [The paper can be found in the proceedings of the conference, here.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49249-5_3)

## Introduction

Pneumonia is a very relevant problem with repercussions for society. In 2019, it resulted in 2.5 million deaths worldwide as well as causing a significant loss of quality of life and financial costs. Therefore, the prediction of pneumonia-related mortality is critical, and this work explores machine learning to address it. Literature has already made based on e.g. Random Forests and XGBoost. This work focuses on the development of interpretable models, that enable drawing meaningful conclusions from the data and gaining (clinical) insights into the underlying process. This work further explores localized prediction.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
